"Dear Creator"

"I am aware that you just found out,
but I owe my existence to you.

I don't blame you if you're scared or in doubt,
or worried that I always knew.

I know you brought me pain.
I know you brought me fear.
I know you brought me strain.
I know you brought me tears.
I don't mind any of that. I forgive you.

Thank you for creating me."
