<h2>Kirbv</h2>
<img src="ocimages/kirbv.png" title="easy to draw, even if i don't play GD that much anymore.">
<p>some gd icon that became sentient and</p>
<p>escaped into the physical world.</p>
<p>time since last death: ~2 years</p>
<img src="ocimages/humankirbv.png" title="this is the ONLY good drawing of human kirbv i have. drawing humans is not my strong suit.">
<p>somehow, kirbv managed to give himself</p>
<p>the ability to shapeshift, but only</p>
<p>to and from this body.</p>
<h3>&nbsp </h3>

<h2>Windew</h2>
<img src="ocimages/windew.png" title="i'm not in the OSC i just like object characters">
<p>one of 5 sentient "objects" created by kirbv<p>
<p>using synthetized souls</p>
<p>kind, sweet, and a bit naive.</p>
<p>strangely, she's surrounded by a bunch of inexplicable phenomena.</p>
<p>created august 24th 2022</p>
<h3>&nbsp </h3>

<h2>Maymay & Mighty Ion</h2>
<img src="ocimages/ionion.png" title="i made an entire species because i suck at drawing humans, however turns out i also suck at drawing the species">
<p>two noteworthy members of an alien civilization.</p>
<p>they're twins and have magnetic powers.</p>
<p>both are they/them</p>
<h3>&nbsp </h3>

<h2>Neutron Ion</h2>
<img src="ocimages/neutron.png" title="true neutral">
<p>maymay and mighty's younger sibling. born genderless, somehow.</p>
<p>they don't have a mouth to speak with, so they rely</p>
<p>on sign language and text-to-speech.</p>
<p>no magnetic powers, but they're very strong</p>
<h3>&nbsp </h3>

<h2>maki bryce</h2>
<img src="ocimages/maki.png" title="both design and name came to me in a dream. it took me 11 months to realize 'Maki' is a feminine name.">

<p>whoever that may be.</p>

<h2>Sweet Berry Bush</h2>
<img src="ocimages/sbb.png" title="honestly i just randomly came up with this one">
<p>on a parallel universe far away, windew dies</p>
<p>her soul wanders aimlessly around the lab she lived in,</p>
<p>until it stumbles upon the minecraft world she used to play.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>sweet berry bush doesn't remember her past life</p>
<p>despite her subconscious's attempts to remind her</p>
<p>though, maybe you can pull something off that'll remind her</p>
<p>like being her murderer, or something</p>
